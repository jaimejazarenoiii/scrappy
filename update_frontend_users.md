# Frontend User Updates

After running the database cleanup script, you'll need to update the frontend code to use the new email addresses.

## Files to Update:

### 1. `src/presentation/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
Update the default business assignment logic:

```typescript
// Change from:
business_id: '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'

// To: (if you want to keep the same business_id)
business_id: '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'
```

### 2. Any hardcoded email references
Search for and replace:
- `owner@scrappy.com` → `jjazarenojr@jst.com`
- `employee@scrappy.com` → `jjazarenojr_employee@jst.com`

### 3. Test the new users
1. Try logging in with `jjazarenojr@jst.com`
2. Try logging in with `jjazarenojr_employee@jst.com`
3. Verify that both users can access the system properly

## Notes:
- The business_id remains the same (`00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`)
- All transaction data has been cleared
- RLS policies are now simplified (authenticated users can access all data)
- The system is now ready for fresh data entry
